<b>The Tax</b>\nMost people let history&nbsp;flow by them. Some stubborn ones try to change history but find that history does&nbsp;not like to be changed. Occasionally there will be a person who happens to be&nbsp;at the right place and right time and bends the river of history to their will.&nbsp;Even more rarely however, there will be a special someone who happens to be&nbsp;there at every major historical moment, a passive observer in the swirls of&nbsp;change. &nbsp;Life can be turbulent for people&nbsp;like that, and they often feel that life should stop twisting and just let&nbsp;things be. Clive Johnson was one such person, although Clive Johnson did not know it yet. &nbsp;\n\nClive was watching the sheep. Clive liked the way they came for their food at the same time everyday. Sheep were predictable like that and Clive liked predictable. That was pretty much how Clive was himself. He woke up at 6:30 every morning and went about his usual routine. First it was the cows, then the sheep and finally the pigs. Sometimes the neighbors would come and disturb his routine with conversation, but Clive found that they tended to leave when he started talking about the sheep. Clive liked talking about the sheep. \"Do you know that sheep that sheep can recognize the voice of their shepherd?\" was his favorite saying.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;But there was a new saying going around town, and it had nothing to do with sheep. Instead it was about a tax of sorts. Apparently the British had raised taxes again. Clive did not like taxes, but only because they took away his sheep. If the British continued with this ridiculous tax thing, he would soon be sheep-less! That wouldn't do. He began to listen more closely to what Adam Jacobs was saying.\n\n\"First it was the Sugar Act, and now the Tea Act? Who do they think they are? We were the ones who helped them win that French and Indian War anyway.\"\n\nAnd Adam was right. Clive himself had participated in French and Indian wars. He had earned the right to live peacefully on his farm. Things were getting out of hand. If this kept up soon there would be no sheep left! He had to do something.&nbsp;\n\n\"I will go to Boston to figure it out\", Clive volunteered. \"As long as someone will take care of my sheep while I am gone\". And with that, Clive had begun an adventure.&nbsp;\n\n<b>The Tea Party\n</b>Boston was a swirl of activity.&nbsp;There were horses and wagons and hay and people rushing all around.&nbsp;You really could not blame Clive for getting swept up into the midst of things. It was just what he&nbsp;did. In the midst of all this confusion a man came up and spoke to Clive.&nbsp;\n\n\"Good Sir, what brings you to Boston?\"\n\n\"I am here to tell the British what I think about their Tea Tax!\" Clive said.&nbsp;\n\n\"Ah, a man after my own heart. Allow me to introduce myself. I am John Tspiller.\"\n\n\"Tspiller? How did you get that name?\"&nbsp;\n\n\"If you follow me I will tell you about it. &nbsp;Tonight we are going to a party. We will be dressing as American Indians. It will be fun. You should join us. Also, if you come I will introduce you to a few of my British mates and you can talk to them about this Tea Tax you care about so much. \"\n\n\"Well that sounds like a good deal. I think I will come.\"\n\n\"Great! Meet us at the harbor at 6 today then. The password is 'BTP'. I will see you there.\"\n\nAnd with that John turned and left Clive to ponder on the exchange. It certainly was a curious exchange and left Clive with a strange taste in his mouth. But he had given his word and he intended to keep it. So slightly before 6 he showed up at the docks and waited for his new friend John.\n\nThere was a strong south wind and soon Clive was shivering. The docks were silent except for the sails billowing in the wind. Clive was just about to turn around and go home when he heard a voice whisper.\n\n\"Password?\"\n\n“Sheep sleep by ships!” answered Clive.\n\n“No you idiot the password that I gave you this morning!”\n\n“Oh. Wait I don’t think I remember that password.”\n\n“Oh forget it. Just come with me.”\n\n“Right. To meet those high ranking British officials right?”\n\nBut it was too late. John was already walking up the gangplank. Clive quickly followed him on board, thinking that it was awfully quiet for a party. The ship was dark and dank and Clive was pretty sure that he saw a few rats scurry off as they heard his footsteps. John seemed to be in somewhat of a hurry and Clive had to quicken his pace to follow him down into the holding area. \n\nOnce in the holding area Clive saw men walking around with chests.&nbsp;\n\n\"What a strange party this is\", Clive thought to himself. Always one to pull his weight, Clive proceeded to help carry boxes on deck.&nbsp;\n\n\"These are pretty heavy huh. I wonder what is in them?\" he voiced to no one in particular.\n\nAfter they had finished bringing them up, he decided to open one to check. It was tea. He turned to remark on the strangeness of the situation to John, but John was busy at the other side of the ship gathering people's attention. As Clive walked closer, he could see that John was directing the men. To his horror, Clive watched the men proceed to dump the tea into the sea!\n\n\"What are you doing? That is good tea!\"\n\nClive ran around trying to stop the people from throwing the tea in, but it was too late. Before long the noise from the ships had awakened the soldiers from their nearby quarters. As the soldiers approached the men started to panic. Some jumped over board while others tried to fight.&nbsp;\n\n\"I am innocent! I did not know they were going to throw tea into the sea! I tried to stop them,\" Clive protested.&nbsp;\n\n\"Tell that to the judge when you see him,\" came the reply.\n\nAnd with that, Clive was hauled away like a common criminal. \"What will happen to the sheep while I am gone?\" he thought as he was thrown into prison.&nbsp;\n\n<b>War\n</b>As it turns out, Clive should have been more worried about himself than for the sheep. War was in the air. Soon after the tea fiasco, now being called the Boston Tea Party, the British issued the Intolerable Acts. This only made things worse. It made it significantly worse for Clive because now he was something of a hero. Despite his protests, he was freed from prison and enlisted as part of the Patriot militia, under the direct command of George Washington.\n\nIt was never Clive's desire to fight in the war, but if did he generally wanted to be on the winning side. This however, did not seem to be the case. Over the course of the next 2 years the British inflicted several significant defeats to the Americans, capturing New York and Philadelphia. American morale was low and there was talk of severe punishment for those leading the rebellion.\n\nWashington knew he had to do something to raise the morale of his troops. \n\n\"What do you think we should do Clive?\"\n\n\"I think people are like sheep. All they need is something simple to make them happy. Where do you think we could get a small victory?\"\n\n\"Oh I don't know. It doesn't seems like we have much of a chance anywhere..\"\n\n\"How about Trenton?\"\n\n\"The crossing would be difficult. We might not even be able to get our men across the river. But it seems like we do not have much of choice in the matter. Trenton it is.\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<b>The Declaration</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n
